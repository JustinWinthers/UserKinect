UserKinect
===========

An embeddable javascript visual feedback and bug tracker tool
-------------------------------------------------------------

UserKinect is a user feedback tool that allows users to input feedback quickly, and annotate a given web page.
UserKinect takes a snapshot of the page with the annotations and attaches the image and the users feedback to
a ticket it generates in the issue management tool of your choice.  Out of the box, UserKinect integrates with
Jira.  I developed UserKinect as a response to the fact that many tools of this nature are overpriced in my
opinion and often an organization has privacy concerns that prohibit them from many of the cloud solutions that
are offered.  UserKinect is free, and can be installed easily within an organizations firewall.  I'm hoping
developers will join the project and help add more features and integrations with other CRM and issue management
tools to UserKinect.  UserKinect is written in pure JavaScript with an API layer written in NodeJS.


Simply embed it in your project like so:

```html
<script src="http://www.userkinect.com/userKinect.js?project=yourJiraProject&component=someJiraComponent&env=PROD&issuetype=yourIssueType"></script>
```

Or download your own version and serve it on your internal network.
